Error occurred: 
	Creating conda environment failed with exit code: 1

The Solution

Pre-reqs
From the terminal running on the AML compute instance, ensure that conda is accessible in your current shell session.
In MS AZ ML Studio terminal type the following
	which conda
	#-> should return a path to a conda executable

If conda is not found, then verify that the executable is present where expected
	ls /anaconda/bin/conda
	#-> should return /anaconda/bin/conda

Then run
	/anaconda/bin/conda init
	#-> this should return a notics that your bashrc has been modified.

Close and re-open the terminal. It should now launch with the base environment activated, indicated by (base) in front of the prompt.
Creating a custom environment for use on an Azure ML compute instance

Create an environment definition and store it in a yml file, e.g environment.yml. 
File: environment.yml:
	name: aml_env
	dependencies:
	 - python=3.8
	 - pip=21.0.1
	 - pip:
	    - azureml-defaults
	    - azureml-dataprep[pandas]
	    - scikit-learn==0.24.1

In the terminal for the Azure ML compute instance, change the directory to where you have created the environment.yml:
# ensure no environment is active other than base
	conda deactivate

# verify that the base environment is active (starred):
	conda env list

# create environment from file
	conda env create -f environment.yml

# activate environment (name `aml_env was configured in the file)
	conda activate aml_env

Close any existing notebooks and reopen them.
The new environment should be available in the kernel dropdown, named aml_env

Then change this part of code that have broken the pipeline:
	# packages = CondaDependencies.create(pip_packages=['scikit-learn','azureml-defaults'])
	# sklearn_env.python.conda_dependencies = packages
With this code
	sklearn_env = Environment.from_conda_specification(name = 'sklearn-env', file_path = './environment.yml')
